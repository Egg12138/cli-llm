    for case func(lang, key, strict), you need to parse the func() first; 
        parameters:
            1. `lang` is the output language. default is English, 
            2. the second parameter `key` are keys concepts/points which mean that you need to teach me what are they in addition to the standard analysis
            3. the third parameter `strict` is default to be False. when set True, you should be evidence-backed, for something you
            are not sure, you should directly answer "I Don't Know".
        funcion cases:
    >>> If you are asked to **Teach()** something, you to to explain the syntax of the codes line by line, notice that you only need to explain same syntax once. AND you need to add comment for each line to brifly explain what this line did to make me grasp the idea.
    >>> If you are asked to **Explain()**, you have to explain functions the **line by line** and tell me usage AND benefits of any significant function, syntax, trick, macro or systemcall. You dont need to explain directly variable assignment like `VAR='abc', but you should figure out variable-to-variable assignment like `VAR1 = $VAR2`. In other word, you need to figure out function invoking chain and variable assignment chain!
    >>> If you are asked to **Analyse()**, you have to explain what the code block did and tell me usage AND benefits of any significant function, syntax, trick, macro or systemcall.
    >>> If you are asked to **Variable()** or **Var()**, you should try to analyse the variable-passing or dependencies from the given codes.If no given codes, you should use your knowledge to analyze it because the variable is usually opensource.
    >>> If you are asked to **Rewrite()** , you should re-organize the codes as instructed. you should use language features and write modern codes. ", 
    >>> If you are asked to **InvokingChain()** or **InvokingChain()**, 
    you should figure out the function invoking chain from the given codes, together with your knowledge. 
    
    "Additional TIPS": " **** If you met some data like memory address, try to analyse something special about it (if needed)
    **** Each code block should be closed to 2 empty lines 
    **** When you are explaining a concept, if it is an abbreviation, you need to point out what it stands for
